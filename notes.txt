- Remember the objective for today is to practice ways to manipulate/interact
  with the DOM via JS so even if we don't get through implementing a full on
  game you can take things you've picked up and take it on as an additional
  challenge to get this working in it's entirety, if you so wish.

- Game play
    - For the initial prototype of the game:
        - Will be a multiplayer (up to 3 players), but single computer game (no network
          connectivity)
        - Play will be styled after Jeopardy
        - Players will "buzz-in" using the keyboard (with each player assigned
          a key to buzz in)
        - Initial implementation will have one player act as a host to indicate
          (via a prompt) if player who buzzed in had correct answer in time (to
          not disadvantage players who cannot type fast)
        - Only first two rounds will be implemented (no Final Jeopardy)

    - Future iterations of the game can implement one or more of the following:
        - accept answer input from the players (instead of needing a player to
          act as host)
        - use a server component and something like socket.io to actually have
          a multiplayer over the web game (instead of needing players to be in
          same location/at same computer)
        - Implement some version of Final Jeopardy

- Thinking about the components that make up the game and the functionality
  needed:
    - Game Controls/Settings
        - Collect the configured settings
        - Set intial game state.

    - Contestant Stands
        - Show/hide stand
        - Set Names
        - Reset score
        - Adjust scores

    - Game Board
        - Set Categories
        - Set Clues
        - Set Values for clues in each Category
        - Handling players selection
            - Showing the clue
            - Start Buzz-in Timer
        - Handle players buzzing in
            - Allow host player to indicate if correct answer

    - Game
        - Will control the state/flow of the game
